# Drumduino

Drumdino is a drum kit implementation using an Arduino shield interfaced with Max/MSP for MIDI sound generation and processing.

##Overview
In essence, an Arduino sketch is used to receive and process any impact received on the six pads. This data is sent to Max/MSP and converted to MIDI notes that can be outputted via the AU DLS Synth or be further processed for many interesting applications! 
There were both hardware and software parts to this project, with more emphasis on hardware in relation to producing an optimal sound and the authentic feeling of actually playing the drums. Sensitivity, rebound and types of material to be used in conjunction with Arduino's sensing pins were all factors that needed to be considered before any software implementation, or else the kit (even though not authentic in terms of size & orientation), would not "feel" real when you hit it with a drum stick.



##Background & Objectives
MUMT306 taught me many interesting applications and methods of audio computing throughout this term. A particular one of these tools, the Arduino, was something that I had previous experience dealing with as part of my engineering courses. However, I did not have any knowledge on how to use it in relation to digital audio generation and processing. We had learned how to get the Arduino talking to Max/MSP in class, and my general familiarity with synthesis using Max made me eager to explore more about these ideas. I basically wanted to achieve some possible interesting application of this model of generating sound via Arduino's sensor pins, convert them to MIDI notes in Max, possibly add digital effects or other creative twists along the way.

The first thing I had in my mind was to create a drum sequencer (of the size of the arduino board) that I can attach to an electric guitar and combine the sounds generated by the two, add digital effects to them so that I get something like a "super-instrument".

Force-sensing seemed to be a reasonable starting point to focus on. However, being unfamiliar with the myriad parts that can be used with Arduino, I found myself being inclined to use the Piezo Element to achieve the "knock sensing" functionality after my initial research (instead of arcade buttons, for example, to have multiple force sensors in a smaller surface area). Once I got a hold of some Piezo elements, the first thing that came to my mind as someone who plays the drums was to actually build an electronic drum kit out of them. Reasons for this include:
  - Acoustic drums are very loud! I wanted to be able to create a series of pads that I can adjust the volume with, making it safe to play them at home however I like
  - As a drummer, I always took the whatever the sound that the drums I hit produced for granted (after proper tuning, of course). Now that I know digital processing of sounds, I wanted to rather tweak these sounds and play around with them, producing many possibilities and expanding my horizons in terms of the sound that a drum kit element can produce (cymbals, drums, or even notes)
  - Building a drum kit was a reasonable implementation choice given that I decided to use force sensing resistors as part of this project to create interesting applications with the Arduino
  - The code I would have that senses "knocks" via the Arduino and sends proper messages to Max/MSP for sound generation and processing would be applicable to more than just an electronic drum kit project. So once I finished my drum kit and properly integrated its software, I could easily use the same software (with minor adjustments) to implement my initial project idea of building a small drum sequencer attachable to an electric guitar using arcade buttons as kit elements.

##Example Usage

##Challenging Issues
- Putting together the hardware was much more difficult than how I envisioned it. I had previously worked with integrating circuits with Arduino to build a variety of different electronics in my engineering classes. However, back then I was more inclined to work on the software portions of group assignments during the division of tasks with my groupmates. I let others worry about the hardware while I worked on software, which was more engaging from my perspective. This project taught me, for one thing, that one can not simply neglect the importance of hardware and the existance of its issues when bringing together a project like this from scratch. Software is not everything (even though I want it to be).
- Bringing together the separate parts of hardware to build the kit also proved to be somewhat tedious. A few times I thought I had everything I needed, I realized that some small, yet very important item was missing (like hot glue, spray glue, heat shrink tubes etc. on separate occasions) and I had to get them in order to proceed with being able to do anything at all. This was also the first time that I was not provided with any equipment needed in the building of a project. I learned now that the initial research and brainstorming about parts is extremely important for a time-efficient project design.
- Soldering was also a major issue, as I had never done it before. I did not even know how to properly tin a soldering iron. When I tried to do so after learning about twisting solder on its tip online, I ended up oxidizing the tip of the brand new iron instead, making it obsolete instantly. Only after buying a new one, doing more research on the how-to, and using up two shields and many resistors as practice was I able to learn(although not master) the seemingly simple, yet extremely detailed act of soldering. Even after the tip was tinned just fine, I ended up burning the drum-kit shield that implements circuits for each six pads, so I had to build the circuit manually again. Thankfully, I will be able to solder anything without problem in the future should I need to thanks to this project.

##Rewarding Issues
- During the cutting and gluing pads on top of each other, I felt like I was not doing something quite right (due to lack of experience) and that the producing pad would end up not working, and my efforts might go to waste therefore. I thought I had to cut every single element in perfect circles, glue everything perfectly flat in a golden ratio that only people dealing with electronics for a long time can achieve in order to get desired functionality. Of course, such imperfections are invitations to noise and small, yet significant errors. However, I learned that perhaps one should not be such a perfectionist in terms of building hardware. If something works, and seems that it will be able to work for a long time, it is better than not building anything due to the worry that it will not be perfect.
- When I first glued all the layers of pads together and checked the readings in each sensor, I was certainly getting responses, but I could not correlate these responses with the impact that I apply to the pads. In other words, it seemed like I would not be able to process the responses to get the desired functionality, and that all the tedious efforts of building the kit would be for nothing. However, after some analysis and research, I was able to come up with the "tuning" aspect of my software in order to adjust the response of each pad independently and properly. Software might not be everything, but it is certainly able to cover up hardware imperfections to some extent.


##Conclusion & Future Goals
This was my first project that involved combining hardware and software to perform audio computing. Although the final product is not overly complicated, this was a project that I had the most fun building since it became something I can personally relate to as a drums player in the end. When trying to come up with a topic, I came across some extremely interesting musical applications of the concepts that we learned about in class (specifically, using the Arduino). This project helped me create a more solid connection in my mind about the topics of MUMT306 and how they can be applied to real life projects. Hopefully this project will be the first step I take towards a possible carreer in this area. My goal is to expand this drum kit by applying a variety of synthesis techniques such as recording and looping a sequence played so that one can play/hear/process multiple rhythmic patterns at the same time and build on each one, applying digital effects to a pad's output in real time.
