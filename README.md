# Drumduino

Drumdino is a drum kit implementation using an Arduino shield interfaced with Max/MSP for MIDI sound generation and processing.

##Overview
In essence, an Arduino sketch is used to receive and process any impact received on the six pads. This data is sent to Max/MSP and converted to MIDI notes that can be outputted via the AU DLS Synth or be further processed for many interesting applications! 
There were both hardware and software parts to this project, with more emphasis on hardware in relation to producing an optimal sound and the authentic feeling of actually playing the drums. Sensitivity, rebound and types of material to be used in conjunction with Arduino's sensing pins were all factors that needed to be considered before any software implementation, or else the kit (even though not authentic in terms of size & orientation), would not "feel" real when you hit it with a drum stick.



##Background & Design Choices
MUMT306 taught me many interesting applications and methods of audio computing throughout this term. A particular one of these tools, the Arduino, was something that I had previous experience dealing with as part of my engineering courses. However, I did not have any knowledge on how to use it in relation to digital audio generation and processing. We had learned how to get the Arduino talking to Max/MSP in class, and my general familiarity with synthesis using Max made me eager to explore more about these ideas. I basically wanted to achieve some possible interesting application of this model of generating sound via Arduino's sensor pins, convert them to MIDI notes in Max, possibly add digital effects or other creative twists along the way.

The first thing I had in my mind was to create a drum sequencer (of the size of the arduino board) that I can attach to an electric guitar and combine the sounds generated by the two, add digital effects to them so that I get something like a "super-instrument".

Force-sensing seemed to be a reasonable starting point to focus on. However, being unfamiliar with the myriad parts that can be used with Arduino, I found myself being inclined to use the Piezo Element to achieve the "knock sensing" functionality after my initial research (instead of arcade buttons, for example, to have multiple force sensors in a smaller surface area). Once I got a hold of some Piezo elements, the first thing that came to my mind as someone who plays the drums was to actually build an electronic drum kit out of them. Reasons for this include:
  - Acoustic drums are very loud! I wanted to be able to create a series of pads that I can adjust the volume with, making it safe to play them at home however I like
  - As a drummer, I always took the whatever the sound that the drums I hit produced for granted (after proper tuning, of course). Now that I know digital processing of sounds, I wanted to rather tweak these sounds and play around with them, producing many possibilities and expanding my horizons in terms of the sound that a drum kit element can produce (cymbals, drums, or even notes)
  - Building a drum kit was a reasonable implementation choice given that I decided to use force sensing resistors as part of this project to create interesting applications with the Arduino
  - The code I would have that senses "knocks" via the Arduino and sends proper messages to Max/MSP for sound generation and processing would be applicable to more than just an electronic drum kit project. So once I finished my drum kit and properly integrated its software, I could easily use the same software (with minor adjustments) to implement my initial project idea of building a small drum sequencer attachable to an electric guitar using arcade buttons as kit elements.
